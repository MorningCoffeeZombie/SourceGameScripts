# Garry's Mod for Linux tends to crash and have instability issues
# Allegedly some of this is due to GMod using Internet Explorer protocols to download server files
# For some reason GMod might actually have a chance of running when you run the following commands:

cd ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod
./hl2.sh
