Disguises should only demote you to your original class

pickpocketing / ziptying / metal detector infront of cop shloundt auto want
	its their job to do these things, makes it OP 
	auto wants even if cop isnt paying attention

prop blocking jails = no different than prop blocking bases

the popups of who's wanted should be disable-able

jail shouldnt remove hp buffs

player names should be the same in game as on forums (pull from same db)....shits confusing
	website profiles should list all previous aliases of players cuz confusing...
