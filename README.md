# SourceGameScripts
Scripts for Valve (Steam) games to improve performance and/or change the experience.
Files are named based on the applicable game and usage. Files prefixed by "source_" are agnostic and may work with any game.
Add 'autoexec.cfg' to all/any Steam games and uncomment the lines beginning with "exec" to activate the other scripts. This is the master control file.
